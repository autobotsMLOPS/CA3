2) Add more features to the calculator.py file, such as square root, power, factorial, etc. Assigned to: Ahmed
3) Create a flask_app.py file that imports the calculator.py file and creates a Flask application that wraps around its functions. Assigned to: Zeerak
4) Create a Dockerfile that specifies the instructions for building a docker image for the flask application.  Assigned to: Faraz
5) Create a GitHub repository for the project and push the main.py, and Dockerfile files to it.  Assigned to: Ahmed
6) Create a GitHub action that triggers when a push event occurs on the master branch and builds and uploads the docker image to your docker hub account. Assigned to: Zeerak
7) Test the docker image by downloading it from your docker hub account and running it on your local machine. Check if the flask application works as expected by accessing it via http://localhost:5000/calc/<operation>/<num1>/<num2>.  Assigned to: All
